      <h2>About Sustainability Goal</h2>
      <h5>Quality Education</h5>
      <img src="goal4.png" class="img" alt="SDG-Quality-Education"></img>
      <p class="ex-tiny"><strong>"Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"</strong></p>
      <p>
        The fourth Sustainable Developement Goal, Quality education, was made to ensure that all people recieve a propper fufilling Education.
        This because over half of the worlds adolescents aren't meeting reading and mathematic proefficiency standards, mostly in third world countries,
        and since they are the future of the planet, we need to ensure that they are educated well enough to take care.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Main Topic At Hand</h2>
      <h5>New York Public Elite High Schools</h5>
      <img src="topic.jpg" class="img" alt="Stuyvesant High School"></img>
      <p class="ex-tiny"><strong>The Bronx High School Of Science has one of the lowest acceptance rates of students of opposite races.</strong></p>
      <p>
        The main issue disccused is focused on New York's Elite Public High School System, where students take a specialiezed test, in which they
        are required to get a certain cutoff score for the school that they wish to get into. Going off this desciption, there is already a lot of
        red flags in place. Since these are "Elite" Schools, the cutoff scores are usually very high, so there is a very small percentage that get
        accepted is vert high. the test is out of 600, and the highest cutoff score goes to Stuyvesant High School, with 560. this goes against SDG#4,
        because not everyone is getting a fair chance to this Education, and the way the system is functioned can also tend to leave out minnority
        groups, in 2019, only seven black students getting accepted. this just on of the examples showing the issue.
