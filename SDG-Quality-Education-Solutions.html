      <h2>Support to Create a New Law</h2>
      <h5>Solution#1</h5>
      <img src="law.jpeg" class="img outline" alt="New Law"></img>
      <p>Convince the new york legislative to create a new law that would make access easier to Elite High Schools</p>
      <p>
        My first idea for a solution would be to get the new york legislative to change the law
        that makes the exam manditory because it is slightly biased on how students are broken.
        this would be effective because it would give use the opportunity to creat a better system
        on how students are selected. this however, while has cause and reason to happen, and is
        also the most probabably, would take the longest time to come in to fruition because at
        current time state government has put a hold to the issue, not wanting to deal with complaints.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Revamping the test to be more equal</h2>
      <h5>Solution#2</h5>
      <img src="final-exam.jpg" class="img outline" alt="Fair & Equal Tests"></img>
      <p>Making tests more equal and and fair for sudents of different ablities</p>
      <p>
        The entrance exam to enter these schools is too high stakes and really messes with the
        examinees, and only tests students of their mathematic and language skills, which while
        important, isn't and acurate say in the students skills and abilities, and the required
        score to enter most schools is too high, so many students end up failing. A solution to
        this would be to require elite schools to lower the acceptance score to give better
        chances for students, and to make the test more open the students range of abilites,
        like science, social studies, or just general skills like problem solving and research.
        this however wouldn't be very efficent as many people would be opposed to the of changing
        the tests, and schools would possibly deny it saying it would defect from what makes the 
        system special
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>personalized tests and interviews</h2>
      <h5>Solution#3</h5>
      <img src="personal.jpg" class="img outline" alt="Personalized Testing"></img>
      <p>Give more personalized exams and interviews for the schools to better know the student</p>
      <p>
        this solution allows schools to better know the students they are possibly going to accept.
        instead of a general exam that all students would take, each student would be assigned a
        testing center where they would go to testing and interviewed, based on privous academic
        records and what the students are personally willing to strive for. Unfortunately this is
        one of  the more unprobable one to come to, as personally interviewing all examinees would
        be taxing on resources, and would take too much time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="tiny" style="text-align: center;">(Personal Favorite): aboishment of Elite School system and make and schools equally as Good</h2>
      <h5>Solution#4</h5>
      <img src="broken-chain.jpg" class="img outline" alt="Abolish The Elite"></img>
      <p>Some text..</p>
      <p>
        this is my personal favorite solution because instead of fixing the issue, we are abolishing it
        entirely. we would eliminate the need for student to endure hardships whilst taking an intensive
        just to fail and recieve nothing out of it. Instead, we would make sure that all high schools
        are able to provide a near equal experience to that of the Elite School System, benefiting all
        students, not just a select few. unfortunately, as much as i wish for this solution to come into
        fruition, it is also the one with the most holes in it, such as being very resource intensive, and
        and would also be the plan with the most backlash.
