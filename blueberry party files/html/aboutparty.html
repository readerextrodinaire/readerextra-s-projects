    <p>The Blueberry Party is a party that values equality and safety. We want to change not only our country, 
       but our world to be a safer and equal place. Our main goals are to give equal rights to same-sex couples,
       banning all assault rifles and getting background checks for hunting rifles, supporting refugees and providing
       them with the same rights and benefits as citizens, reducing climate change and create laws to benefit the
       environment, and lastly, to provide free healthcare equally among all citizens in order to keep the United
       States citizens safe. Our goals all tend to share one overall theme: safety. The Blueberry Party wants to
      ensure safety and equality for all Americans regardless of race, sexuality, class, religion, or where they came from.
